\title{Obtain p-values from Permutations}
\usage{
perm_pvals(B, npoints, data = pit_LvL, obs_diff = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{B}{the number of permutations to run}

\item{npoints}{the number of grid points in each direction.  Densities are
calculated at each one of these grid points.}

\item{data}{the data.frame containing pitch location and pitcher
responsibility.  Defaults to \code{pit_LvL}.}

\item{obs_diff}{The observed difference in densities.  If specified manually,
should come from \code{\link{obs_diff}}.  Defaults to NULL, in which case
it will be calculated using \code{\link{obs_diff}}.}
}
\description{
Wrapper which uses \code{\link{dens_diff}}, \code{\link{perm_diffs}}, and
\code{\link{calc_pvals}} to obtain p-values at each grid point.
